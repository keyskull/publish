Date: 23 February 2021

This paper is talking about the business intelligence application on a study case. In the paper, I will use my work experience as the study case to identify the business intelligence applications with my understanding. About my work experience, I was working in an outsourcing company which is delivering software/hardware products to business clients. I was a back-end software engineer in the company, which correspond to develop business logical system and management system program with each single clients' products. In my work process, we use several business intelligence applications to handle our company's business, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, Reporting System, and some kind data analytic tool, Tableau, etc. To About the business intelligence application, I will try to identify some of the business intelligence application from my work experience and explain the specific business intelligence application detail.

To my work experience with my previous company, we have to work with several business intelligence applications. About my previous company business, the main business is the field on supply software development supporting service and hardware development assistance to the companies who need someone to help them up for their business goal. That kind of company so-called "outsourcing company" that how the business running with.

In my position as a Back-End software engineer, I responsive in developing client's product back-end systems and our company managing system. About my experience in the company, I developed several interactive service systems, developed and substituted a portion of the company's internal systems with Scala programming language, using the Domain-driven design (DDD) model for project development, and assisted Front-end Developers in troubleshooting, etc. While I doing many of these works, I actually rarely due with business intelligence applications since I work as a developer. Moreover, some of my work is related to design database architectures which are related to business intelligence. I had due with some business intelligence application development such as the Online transaction processing (OLTP) system and Online analytical processing (OLAP) system.

An online transaction processing system record business interaction as they happen. They support the day-to-day operation of an organization.(Larson, 2016) To related a field I involved with the Online analytical processing (OLTP) system development in my company, we have applied star schema as the database architecture; saving the raw data form all the customers' order transactions. The purpose of our company stored all the customers' order transaction data is used to analyze our business movement correctness.

An Online analytical processing (OLAP) systems enable users to quickly and easily retrieve information from data, usually in a data mart, for analysis. OLAP systems present data using measures, dimensions,hierarchies, and cubes. (Larson, 2016) Related to my company, one of the Online analytical processing (OLAP) system as the OLAP Cube face to the different employee such as analysts, project managers that use to managing the product producing process. In my recognition, there porting system is having those features such as generating documentation with different dimension of the facts, financial controlling. Related to business intelligence, our reporting system is the implantation of Online analytical processing (OLAP) system. There porting system in our company has support from the Online analytical processing (OLAP) system to show the different dimensions of data to analysts. The data sources for reporting system is from the Online analytical processing (OLAP) systems as we mentioned the system stored all the raw data of customer transactions.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the systems and processes that a business has in place to measure and improve how the company interacts with and influences customers. (WARD, 2020) For our department of public relations, I recognized they also have using a business intelligence application of Customer Relationship Management(CRM) system. Employee they use this system to aggregate the information of the customers then via those data to connect with customers.

Customer relationship management systems gather data about customers and how they interact with your business, which can then be used to(WARD, 2020):

-   Improve customer service

-   Guide the customer\'s buying journey

-   Drive product development

-   Personalize advertising

-   Find new customers

-   Increase sales


In now day, many business intelligence applications are influencing enormous business in most of successful companies. Using business intelligence application could import effective of the business decision, company movement, and quality of producing process, etc.Through my recognition, my previous company is using some part of business intelligence management tools, online transaction processing(OLTP) system, online analytical processing (OLAP) system, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Those business intelligence applications are helpful in many aspects when I am working with. For example, when I am developing a management system for managers use, the business intelligence framework is effective to help to implement some features. Nevertheless, business intelligence applications are complicated, thus some of the company hardly to use on those applications.
